# Introduction
GLS (Gate level simulation) is performed after synthesis, where the RTL design is transformed into a gate-level netlist consisting of logic gates and flip-flops. GLS verifies that the synthesized design maintains the intended functionality, checks for timing violations, and ensures the circuit will behave correctly when implemented in hardware. It provides a more accurate representation of real hardware behavior compared to RTL simulation and is an essential step in the digital design verification flow.

Now lets look at GLS waveform of Babysoc after synthesis.
